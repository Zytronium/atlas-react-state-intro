# React State Introduction

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
- Open `http://localhost:5173` in a browser

### Important Files/Folders

- `index.html`: This is the html file that appears when the dev server starts up.
- `src`: All javascript/jsx code goes in this directory
- `src/assets`: Any static assets such as images that are loaded through the javascript files goes here.
- `src/app.jsx`: The is the main app component for the entire app.
- `test_server.js`: This is an Express server that runs the website built to `dist` so you can test the built version without deploying to production, since some things do work differently. 

### Important Commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts dev server with Hot Module Reloading on port 5173. Anytime a file changes, the changes will automatocally be reflected in the browser
- `npm run lint`: Run the lint checker with eslint to check for known linting issues
- `npm run format`: Run prettier to automatically reformat files
- `npm run test-dist`: Build and run the distributable website to preview the final build before deploying to production
